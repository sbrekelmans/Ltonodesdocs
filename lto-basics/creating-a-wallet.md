# Creating a wallet

## Requirements

1. A desktop with a browser. This will work on mobile as well, but make sure you write your seed down correctly and securely if you do!

## Step 1. Open the LTO web wallet

Head over to https://wallet.lto.network and click on "Create Account", and after that, "Continue".

## Step 2. Choose a name for your wallet and a password

Your account will be stored locally on your device. If you clear the cache, it will be gone and you will need to re-import your seed phrase, which you should get in the next step.

## Step 3. IMPORTANT! Store your seed phrase securely!

Storing these 15 words is the only backup you have of your tokens. Make sure you have them written down somewhere. As long as you don't clear your cache, you won't need them, but once you do, these 15 words are the only way to regain access to your coins! This could be over a year from now.

If you lose these words, you will lose your coins!
{% endhint %}

## Step 4. Verify you have written the seed down correctly.

Click on the seed words in the correct order. If you make a mistake, you can click on "Back" and try it again. This step is mandatory, so you need to verify all the words before being able to continue. Once you finish this step, your account is ready for use!
